* The wariness of travel: didn't want to be nice, reasonable or sociable by the
  end of my first flight. Maybe drank too much (glass of red wine + bailey's)
* The responsibility of writing: memories are much too fleeting.
* How to approach the whole mom + nashville + zika conundrum.
* The people I love, I try to enjoy, but I feel like I should do more.
* What a strange transition it is, to be in neither of my cities, to feel like
  I'll see Tina again that evening but won't, to feel like I won't see my
  parents for dinner, but will.
* Also going back to spanish: how strange it is to address airline people in it,
  and then suddenly, everyone.
* Catching up with stephanie and her Yellow epiphany.
* Pining for hiking again: looking at Yamil's adventure this weekend.
