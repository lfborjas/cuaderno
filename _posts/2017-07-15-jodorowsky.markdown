"You're too shy to introduce yourself, I'll introduce you", said Tina during lunch, "this guy is your hero, you're so nervous, but it'd be so cute to meet in person!"; I admitted as much: I was as nervous as a schoolboy is when the day for a big exam he's sorely underprepared for comes. And today was an evaluation, a meeting of teacher and pupil, of sorts: we were finally meeting Alejandro Jodorowsky. 
I first got acquainted with his work, like most artists I like, by pretending to like his work without actually seeing it, back in college. A good friend of mine recommended me his films El Topo, Santa Sangre and Holy Mountain as great achievements in enlightened cinema, and also lent me "El Maestro y las Magas", one of his autobiographical books, at some point, and I took those mentions and physical interaction with a book I didn't read at the time as enough familiarity to tell people on twitter that I totally liked Jodorowsky, name-dropping him when interacting with seemingly more artful internet denizens; enough to return the book unread almost a year after and never actively seek a copy of the films to finally watch.

At some point right out of college I decided (rather, discovered) it was immature and foolish to pretend to like someone's art just because it's cool, and took the more minimalist (or indeed, integral) approach of only ever referencing artists that I had put in the work of getting acquainted with; and since there were so many names I had been floating with little to no familiarity, bigger names like Beethoven, Scriabin or Baudelaire, newer, more arcane artists receded into obscurity, including Jodorowsky. It wasn't until 2014, much later, that I watched The Holy Mountain and The Dance of Reality and realized that this was a man that had sought and found some things I also had sought and found at that stage of my life: what Alan Watts calls "the way of the sly man", the universal jest, the unity with the Self, the finding out one doesn't have a head or that other and external are just as part of me as my internal organs, or whathaveyou; this was another guru of eclectic spirituality, playful zest and unbounded creativity that beckoned me to follow his path, in my own path. As I often do, I became obsessed: bought all the books I could get my hands on, finally read El Maestro y las Magas (as well as The Dance of Reality, the novels, the poetry, the tarot books and even some of the psychomagic stuff), watched all his movies, bought the Marseille deck than he and Camois refurbished, discovered the work of his sons Adán and Brontis and even contributed to the kickstarter for his latest movie, Endless Poetry (and was overjoyed when I received the poetic money as a "reward"). I felt as connected to this exuberant, prolific, irreverent man as I felt alien to his personality, and, like Alan Watts before him, I wanted to absorb everything in their lives that I could use as some sort of light to elucidate my own deeply hidden gift to the world. Needless to say, I talked people's ears off about him whenever I caught them unawares, and my beloved Tina surely sat through many an exultant pontification. So when we went to Europe in 2015, it wasn't an insane request when I proposed to plan our itinerary to stop by Paris mid-week, between our landing in Barcelona and our meeting with her family in Frankfurt, to go to one of his famous wednesday tarot readings. 

On the wednesday we were supposed to see Jodorowsky, we woke up early and checked his twitter feed. He had just announced the day before that he'd be in Nice for vacation after an exhausting post-production stage for his latest film. We missed him by a week. We took some sad photos in front of the café where he conducts the readings and resigned ourselves to probably never meeting him in person.

Last weekend, when browsing the events page for The Rubin Museum--which we for some reason like a lot even though we have only ever been there twice--we noticed that there was an event with Jodorowsky in the name. Closer inspection revealed it to be a dialogue about music and consciousness, an in-person dialogue, which meant that.
