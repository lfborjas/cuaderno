I only remember our old wine red Honda, the sidewalk in the fancy neighborhood
where my mom's older brother lived, some grown men logistics discussion and a
quaint parallelogram being loaded onto the humble trunk of our little car,
followed by a frame of sorts. Then the ride home and me seeing the black and
white keys twilit, an array of colorful switches, and the funny sounding word
"Bontempi". The next morning it fully dawned on me that we had acquired a
musical instrument, and that it had been intended for my usage and instruction:
it was an electronic organ. Up to this point, the point of writing this down, I
never quite knew why my family took that organ from my uncle: did he want to get
rid of it and suggest it to them? Did he actually take interest in my
development and thought music would exercise my intellect and cater to my
tendency to stay indoors and revel in the wondrous world of imagination? Did my
family think that and ask for that heirloom as a way of allowing me to expand my
horizons without breaking our meager economy? All I knew back then, as an
oblivious six year-old, was that this fascinating apparatus was indeed an
enticing object of exploration; the battered aqua and white user's manual would
mesmerize me for years on end, it was written in English and Italian as far as I
remember so I was never quite able to parse the instructions, let alone the
musical notation in the sample songs that came within; yet a kind adult who I've
long forgotten -- again, only when writing this down do I even presume their
existence to fill this detail -- took to writing down in a separate piece of
paper which of the colorful switches I should press to get the appropriate
sounds and, by numbering the keys, which keys I should press to play the songs
they've played for me a number of times so I could at least memorize the
rhythm. This keyboard was my first incursion into my own world of music, beyond
the lame recorder lessons I eventually took in elementary school and which at
least gave me the ability to read enough music to disentangle that part of the
manual, and it filled many afternoons for many years until the organ was so run
down it wouldn't even start anymore and we had to give it away -- 10 years, two
cities and about four house moves after it came into my life. It's one of the
few memories I have from the two-year sojourn my family had in a different city
my dad had moved us for work: an older cousin coming by and playing music with
me, my figuring out of some christmas carols to play during a christmas eve
party and then chickening out at the last minute, me adding my own notes to the
fabled user's manual, my little brother messing with it, my old and reliable
"When The Saints Go Marching In", first song in the manual, first song in my
head, my pride and joy.

That's my earliest memory of a life-long relationship with music: always a
refuge, always a mystery, always a bridge to people close to me, and always being
forgotten, overridden by the more pragmatic concerns of life: after the first
couple of years of my fantasies as a keyboardist I scaled back to just playing
the recorder and half dreading half loving the music class at school: it was a
ton of memorizing facts about long-dead fellas wearing wigs. 

A significant part of my journey in finding my identity back in high school had
revolved around music: upon discovering my uncle's Yamaha guitar and listening
to my dad's recordings of Los Indios Tabajaras -- which in themselves were a
memento of his own audiophile father -- I became deeply interested in the
instrument and spent many hours while visiting my uncle trying to extract sounds
of its arcane mechanism of wonder while parsing his old battered guitar theory
book. That same year, by sheer fate, the music class at school moved on from its
recorder-only instruction to a diversified set of courses focusing on keyboards,
guitar and the old reliable recorder for those who didn't care much; I jumped at
the opportunity to take guitar despite the minor quibble of my lacking such an
expensive instrument knowing that fate would come to my aid again if my true
calling was the guitar, and it did: another uncle had a very old guitar laying
around which he didn't mind lending me, and thus I came across my first paramour
in a guitar with a bent neck making the action about half an inch high and the
acoustics terrible, adorned with stickers and an inexplicable zebra print acting
as a makeshift pickguard; but I didn't care about the pain and risible
ergonomics of such an instrument, I practiced with zeal, learning all
the songs with a fiery perfectionism. Soon, as with all my learning endeavors
that turn compulsive, I was looking for music to learn and fell into the
temptation of Satan: despite being a fervent christian and having limited myself
to listening only christian rock, I had been listening to "wordly" music before
and knew that they, surely to seduce and ensnare the just, tended to have more
texture and complexity in their musical arrangements; I approached one of my
least satanic classmates and asked for a recommendation, he produced the
Apocalyptica albums where they cover metallica -- we still circulated cassettes
back then, mind you, so most of my journey here involves good old magnetic
piracy -- and I listened in awe, making weekend trips to the internet café to
download ASCII tabs, save them on floppy disks and then painstakingly transcribe
them to notebooks because printing was an expensive dream in the internet café,
reserved to important homework, and then trying to follow along with the
liberally arranged Apocalyptica covers and miraculously learning Nothing Else
Matters by Metallica in this fashion, interspersed with some riffs from
Californication by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

At this point, as in a Christian documentary against the evils of the world, I
had fallen in the slippery slope of the music of the devil: no longer satisfied
with a replica of Metallica, I started listening to the real thing and hanging
out with the other guitar enthusiasts, spending our recesses practicing and
talking about life (of which I had none so I just replied in uncommitted
witticisms or fabricated anecdotes), in complete awe of both the music they were
acquainted with and the lives they lived: I had unwittingly found a group I
belonged to beyond just being classmates or fellow churchgoers, and despite our
wildly differing life experiences, we connected with music every day. 

One morning, sitting next to some kid I barely knew on the bus to school, I
correctly appraised his ownership of a Discman, and was rewarded by my excellent
sleuthing by being offered an earbud, a glimpse into his portable private world;
curiosity and gratitude prompted me to lodge a still earwaxed piece of plastic
in my sacrosanct ear canal and as soon as the music began I stopped caring about
the dubious hygiene of this decision: this was rock, this was metal, but it was
far more melodic and complex than my puny experience before it, this was fucking
Iron Maiden. This was the good stuff, this was the hard drug of Satan and I
could smell the sulphur and it smelled great. For the first time ever, I saved
up 20 lempiras and asked the Discman man to burn me a copy of this glorious
opus, and I listened to it in rapt attention in the sanctuary of my room
blasting it from the tiny speakers of my hewlett packard computer (I didn't dare
use the sound system in the living room, lest I opened the gates of hell) for 30
minutes every afternoon after arriving from school before my mom showed up with
my siblings, and then in my new fangled earphones as soon as I procured one, my
obsession deepened, my acoustic guitar -- I had finally convinced my dad to buy
one, a $100 Suzuki with surprisingly beautiful acoustics and a bright orange
body that made me both self conscious and proud for the rest of the first year
of my tryst with music -- wasn't enough anymore, I had my eyes set on an
electric guitar.

And thus by the end of high school, merely three years after I had first put my
hands on a guitar, I owned a silver/black Hohner stratocaster replica, a small
10W Marshall amplifier, a Metal Zone pedal, a budding collection of devil music
and more than two black garments, and a very deep conflict between my fate and
the sensuous world of Baal. But it was in this cognitive, and frankly sometimes
auditive, dissonance that I spent the three months between high school and
college in my grandma's house with the family having moved in there to nurse my
mom's multiple leg fracture completely devoted to discovering and enjoying more
music, making more frequent trips to the internet cafés, broadening my horizons
with the likes of power metal and its kin -- Sonata Arctica, Nightwish,
Therion, Stratovarious, Yngwie Malmsteen, Angra, Manowar, even extreme metallers
like Children of Bodom -- and allowing me to connect, always surreptitiously and
in shy defiance of my faith, with interesting characters in church and the
internet.

A word before the next stage: college in Latin America is an experience that may
seem quaint to the American mind: we stay at our parents' house, treat it mostly
like an extension to high school, and under the aegis (and in conflict with) our
family, we shed the cocoon of teenage angst and face the full extent of our
identity: we clash with our peers, we forswear our belief systems, we grapple
with the idea of having our own income and responsibilities beyond the sanitized
cradle of the educational system. For late bloomers like me, who not only spent
his teenage years in the double bubble of an all-boys catholic school and a very
evangelical church of which I was an enthusiastic participant -- the thirst to
believe truly took part of it but I suspect I also clung to the ability to be
exempt from facing such fearsome rites of passage as partying; it also meant a
time of discovering the opposite sex face to face, without gods and schools in
betwixt.

By the time I set foot in college campus, I saw myself as a metal musician, a
badass guitarist, a guy that wore black but didn't wear actual band tees because
they were expensive and too risqué for my christianity. Music was my bridge,
however, my way of condensing my own self and presenting it in a package that
was understandable by others, and, if they chose to open it, a way in which I
could find kindred spirits for my passion of not only listening to music but
also learning how to make it, how to speak its language, how to find its traces
in literature and science; I easily connected with another couple of guys in my
introductory algebra class, but a girl I had been seeing for a few days in our
vicinity, wearing, like me, dark shades but not going full metal and sporting a
shy pentagram (actually the HIM symbol) on her blue messenger was a more
interesting, and way scarier, connection to make. A couple of days later I
concocted a plan to sit next to her, behind one of my metal buddies, and talk
loudly with the latter about our favorite bands, hoping she would chime in. And
she did, quickly becoming one of my closest friends -- and opening an eight year
relationship that would go through all sorts of travails before even becoming
romantic years after we graduated and to end in all kinds of hurt and a
thankfully amicable and absolute rupture. But back then it was the simple fact
of a shy boy building a bridge with music towards a shy girl, and finding the
treasure of the shared quest within: she was a far more experienced pirate than
I had become at that stage, and we shared our ever increasing loot and discussed
it at length until one day she mentioned that her dad was a big enthusiast of
all things classical and I, wanting to impress her, said "oh yeah, me too, I'm
totally into Beethoven and like Mozart too, they're great". She saw a need for
me to delve into this world and, instead of more metal, gave me her sisters
music appreciation class CD for me to hear samples of many centuries of fine
art music. Stubborn and proud as always, I didn't want to be told what to do and
who to listen to when beginning my exploration of a genre, so half to prove
myself as a smart music listener and half to impress her with my mad music
arcana, I found non mainstream composers like Hector Berlioz or Dmitri
Shostakovich and, soon, was hooked again.

True to my metal persona up to that point, I saw classical music as a boring but
necessary precursor to melodic metal, a fossil sampled and remixed sometimes by
my heroes, but never something worth listening in itself; how wrong I was: here
I was, surrounded by exceedingly complex and pure soundscapes, with textures,
timbres, colors and layers I wouldn't have dreamed of, unaided by electronic
gimmicks and not beholden to formulaic album or radio conventions; music that
lived in pure form in paper and which any group of competent musicians could
bring to life, music that encompassed the entire continuum of human emotion and
could convey one to the depths of hell and the heights of heaven, a language
that far surpassed the symbols that expressed it, the cultures that gave it
birth, the people and machines that produced it, the very air it made dance;
this was a language I wanted to speak, I was obsessed again. I was again
conflicted. Not only did my faith continue to melt in a maelstrom of
uncertainty, my interest in the guitar and metal had ebbs and flows of the
security of my persona as a metal musician and my newfound obsession in the
language of music and its more sublime expressions.

For a couple of years I gave both camps equal airplay, for metal connected me to
my peers more easily -- people from both church and college came to my house to
jam, and to see my new Ibanez guitar -- but at the beginning of my senior year
at college a radical turn of events came to pass. For most of my teenage years I
had been afflicted with ever worsening acne, and the rigors of computer science
had wreak havoc on my face to such an extent that I consented to a course of
treatment based on pills recommended by my dermatologist which required a
commitment of 6 months, a heavy investment by my parents and came with a long
list of side effects and precautions, with a heavy emphasis on the fact that my
acne would be worse during the first few months and that I should avoid long
periods of exposure to the sun. I took the first three months of my treatment as
a complete withdrawal from people, rationalized as just avoiding the sun but
frankly rooted in a plunging self esteem as the condition worsened, and found
myself cloistered in a room full of music and books. 

During the months of my treatment I started reading more music theory, bought
music paper to transcribe Rachmaninov and Chopin to the guitar, continued the
keyboard practice I had abandoned when I was 8 years old due to my younger
brother always disrupting it with his youthful shenanigans, pirated the entire
oeuvre of Beethoven to sit still in the dark listening to his symphonies, piano
concertos and assorted pieces while applying cold compresses of soothing
medication to my swollen face; discovered, via a blog called "El Cuervo López",
the likes of Bruckner and Kalinnikov, as well as the fascinating world of the
rest of the Mahler catalog beyond the symphonies and how it could all change
depending on the conductor: there I knew that Beethoven's 9th by Karajan was
basically a different piece than the 9th by Furtwangler or Klemperer. And, by
way of the 32 piano sonatas by Beethoven, I eventually discovered the beautiful
world of Glenn Gould's Bach: a Bach that didn't sound like old church music but
that instead was music stripped to its very essence, a lone keyboard more
mesmerizing than an entire orchestra, an interpreter with an intriguing story, a
wellspring of creativity that moved me to write poetry, to paint with
watercolor, to write short stories and continue to transcribe music and practice
instruments, to seek with a depth unprecedented this same essence, now nude and
patent, in arts I had erstwhile failed to understand as peers to my goddess
Music: painting, film, the joy of human contact.

I emerged from my self-exile with an exuberance I couldn't have predicted
before, I realized that my moribund faith had to be put down and retired from
church, I declared my love to my musical friend and was rejected and didn't care
much because I had found this joyous light withing, I reconciled metal and
classical and listened to both as I drove to the gym, to the lab to work on my
ambitious dissertation project, to my part time job as a programming lab
instructor and my full time job as an intern for a budding software firm. My
best friend at the time, also co-worker in the aforementioned firm, gave me
Gödel, Escher, Bach as a birthday present and it seemed to bring together
everything: music, computer science, my flirting with the arts. I signed up for
piano lessons and learned how to play Chopin's Prélude 15 (raindrop). I had been
to what could have been the depths of hell in my lonesome company and was now in
the heights of heaven, but saw it all as one crescendo as music had been with
me. 

Again, after an obsessive love affair with music, she took the backseat to the
concerns of quotidian existence: my internship became a full time job, and then
a startup I worked on while also teaching programming in my alma mater, my
driving companion was no longer only music but also audio books on buddhism and
self-realization by the likes of Erich Fromm with a dash of irreverent
characters like Christopher Hitchens or the essays of Emma Goldman. 

The startup became serious enough to be invited to New York City for a summer
accelerator program and, living there with four other dudes in an overpriced
apartment, sleeping on the mattress, books and music were my solace again:
present in subway commutes, long nights coding trying to prepare a semblance of
a prototype, and, most importantly, my first experiences with actual live music:
my friend and I went to all the metal concerts we could afford, first of which
was a dream come true: Apocalyptica at Irving Plaza, Children of Bodom at the
Best Buy Theater, dancing while mildly drunk to electronic music in an
indeterminate bar in Brooklyn -- a feat of successful loss of inhibition I
haven't quite reached again, the Tchaikovsky piano concerto from the first row
of the Avery Fisher hall, seeing the soloist up close (the seat was actually the
cheapest in the house since it would have been a terrible vantage point for any
other performance) and enjoying it so thoroughly that the lady seating next to
me, a long time patron of the arts, commented quite excitedly about my enjoyment
and shared snippets of her life during the intermission. Upon my return, I
started going to the Philharmonic: I didn't think a Honduran orchestra could
have any comparison to the NYPhil but I went to see them anyway since they were
playing Beethoven's ninth, and was humbled, blown away and brought to the brink
of tears by hearing such divine music played in an unassuming church close to
the suburb where I grew up. Even the first time I had sex, which occurred during
this period, yes, more than a full year after I graduated college -- I told you
I have been a late bloomer -- had to do with music: me and a lady I met online
while talking about music on twitter and who had eventually moved to the city
and become part of my circle of friends started going out in the confusing and
awkward manner that only I could pull off, one day we decided to go check out a
chamber orchestra presentation happening at a venue close to where she lived, we
dressed up, I was late but didn't think much of it because it was so close,
drove up, were promptly turned back by the ushers in the parking lot saying
there wasn't space and they were sold out, went back to her place to have some
burgers and a movie and eventually succumbed to the temptations of the flesh in
her couch after I initiated an unexpected but incredibly eager make out session.
We had thought we were compatible because we both impressed each other with our
musical taste, but once we moved beyond that and tried to explore a personal
relationship, we found that even though we shared other interests and tolerated
our personalities, we didn't inspire each other, we didn't seek the
companionship of the other, we didn't build each other up, we were mere
acquaintances. We had used music as a persona, a mask, and time proved that to
not be enough.

I went back to NYC the next summer, this time on my own, and tried to use all my
meager earnings as an exploited consultant to see more live music: I saw Iron
Maiden in New Jersey, my first time outside of NYC, I saw Roger Waters in the
Bronx, I had my very first hangover by going all out with some friends I made in
the newest iteration of the summer program I was now an alum of and, severely
ill-disposed, still managed to go to the philharmonic the next day upon
realizing that it was the last concert of the season; after visiting other
friends in Harlem one night and experiencing the disconcerting experience of a
subway train just deciding to end its route early, I helped another straphanger
make her way out of the tangled rat-infested underground and realized she was a
saxophone player from Kazakhstan; she invited me to see her at the Zinc bar in
the West Village, I showed up, drank some beer, saw the exciting improvisation
sets, hung around till the end waiting for her, not sure if she'd approach me,
walked with her for a bit and got her number -- a first for me -- texted her the
next day inviting her to the philharmonic and never in my life heard back from
her. In a crisis about my professional future, I roamed the streets of New York
just wandering, listening to Delirium -- a Honduran thrash metal band -- or one
of the haunting violin concertos I was into at the time -- mostly Tchaikovsky or
Sibelius, though Schnittke may have been in rotation too -- until one day I
found the Strand bookstore and found myself lost in its myriad tomes, picking up
my first Jorge Luis Borges. I met an interesting german lady who was visiting a
good friend of mine, invited her to see the philharmonic play beethoven's ninth
in central park and was stood up again. Another weekend I let myself dawdle
south until I reached Washington Square Park, and, lured away from the bench I
had finally found to sit down and read on by the whisper of piano notes, I found
the piano man of the park, who played Rachmaninoff, Chopin, and many other
popular tunes in such a unique and sincere voice that I bought the CD he was
selling by awkwardly dropping the requisite amount in one of his two buckets,
grabbing the cardboard package and engaging in the briefest eye-contact
salutation. I went back to that park many times, and one of those joyous Sundays
I found a street market with people selling used stuff and managed to buy a
couple of classical music CDs, one of which included the concerto for two
guitars by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco; I eventually gifted that album to the
grandma who was hosting me that summer, and I will always remember how she
danced a little when she played it. Again, music had come back in the silent
night of the soul. And outside of my brave but fruitless attempts to build a
bridge with music again, towards the end of my stay, after having found peace in
my private delectation of music -- not needing to share it to fully enjoy it --
my intense but slightly healthier tryst with books allowed me to start talking
to a fascinating artist I met at a tech event, deprived of the safety of shared
musical tastes and of the bombast that music had for me (it was a transcendent
experience, so it made me feel exempt of the mundane) and instead confronted by
the mirror held up by literature, she and I soon began to confide in each other
without crutches, without enumerations, falling in love with a whole person
without the mediation of the pizzazz I had carefully but deceitfully constructed
with music. But by the end of my visit, this was all still in the future, and we
only saw each other twice after our initial meeting -- one of which was a
rendezvous on my last night in the city at a café across the street from Strand
which was interrupted by each of us having to meet with our mentors. 

After five months, and a final ten days spent in the excellently located
apartment of Alex, one of the kindest souls I know, getting my life back
together to the tune of Delirium and Bach, I went back home. Nary two months
after my return, bitten by the wanderlust bug and trying to disentangle myself
from the confusion I had woven for myself in the romantic department, I used my
limited savings to visit friends in Europe. I saw the dutch philharmonic play
Prokofiev, Wagner and The Magic Flute in Berlin, visited the graves of Dvorak
and Smetana in Prague, meandered along the wall of the Vysehrad while looking at
the Vltava river while listening to the symphonic poem by Smetana himself
christened after it, part of Ma Vlast; I used "Kundera" as the password to pick
up my tickets to the Czech opera and saw Othello and Carmen. I remember my
friends, I remember our adventures, but my most vivid memories are again invaded
by music, by her whispers, her solace, her refuge from all in the world which
demanded of me action, engagement, swiftness -- she gave me a space to
contemplate, to be part of the air, to make time stand still and then dance. But
I had to go back to real life.

In the following years up to this day, I've kept a job, come out of a toxic
relationship built upon the dreamy foundations of music, found solace again in
the guitar and while doing so was blessed with finding the love of my life in
the girl I met on one of my respites from my musically-inclined self-exiles two
years prior; I've continued to pursue any opportunities to be surrounded by my
brethren seeing  live music, finding Rush and their intellectual and adult
substitute for the angst I found ten years before in purely angry music. In this
latest interval I've had the darkest times and also the highlights of my young
life, and even though music has taken the backseat again, she's been there, a
mirror to my soul.

And now, as has been the case many times throughout this recollection, I realize
to my chagrin that music, even though it has saved my soul in many ways and been
the constant in my life I can use as a reference to explore my own life events,
has also been an escape, a crutch, a way of distancing myself from others and
from my own responsibility to engage in life, a passion practiced in secret to
the direct benefit of no one other than myself; but perhaps I've slowly learned
to synthesize the two aspects: the escape and the enrichment, and can say that
this mirror to my soul I have found in music has shaped who I am today, it's
showed me an escape but also a bridge, an excuse for snobbery but also a way of
understanding my peers by their enjoyment of rhythm, a lesson in sharing when
appropriate but also in respecting boundaries. An overwhelming goddess that
defined me when I let her but also the light in my soul when I outgrew her. Time
will tell how this ineluctable constant in my life continues to tell my story, I
still don't know what she has for me in the end, and what I have for her, but
I'm glad to realize I didn't have to evade myself from life to enjoy her again,
but have been able to integrate her into my life, as I slowly engage more, seize
more, love more.
